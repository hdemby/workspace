        It will eventually be provided by reading a text file stored on the device. 
        The words will be presented one at a time at a set rate of speed with an extra pause at the end 
        of a sentence. I will later add controls to review wind the text to the last sentence. 
        I will also be adding controls to save the text at the current point so the reader can 
        resume at a later time. The ultimate version will provide feedback on reading rate, 
        percentage completed and time spent reading. </string>
