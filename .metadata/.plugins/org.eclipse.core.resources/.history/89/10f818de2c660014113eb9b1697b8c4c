	Alan Mathison Turing, OBE, FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/ TEWR-ing;  was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, pioneering computer scientist, mathematical biologist, and marathon and ultra distance runner. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of &quot;algorithm&quot; and &quot;computation&quot; with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.[2][3][4] Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</string>
