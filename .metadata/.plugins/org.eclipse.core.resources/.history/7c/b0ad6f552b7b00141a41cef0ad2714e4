    <string name="content_text">This test will be displayd one word at a time to facilitate 
        speed reading using the spritz method. I hope to include the text from the course 
        lectures or selectable content for this app if time allows. 
            The idea is to take a text document and display one word at a time in a textview
        at a pre-defined rate. The working app should satisfy the grading rubric and more. The process
        includes converting the text into a list of words. Each word will be displayed in the center of the 
        window and then replaced after a short delay. Periods will trigger a slightly
        extended pause to help pacing. Tabs will be used to determine paragraphs.
            I hope to later add controls to pause, save and rewind the text
        by one sentence. The save function will allow the reader to save their reading
        position for later sessions. I also hope to add feedback controls that report
        precentage progress through the text, time spent reading, and the current reading 
        rate. If I have the time I will also include a file cnooser to allow the user to
        load new text documents. Perhaps I can figure out a way to save multiple reading sessions 
        with their last reading position rounded to the previous sentence or paragraph. 
        I'm hoping this will be a very useful program out of the box. I can also think of
        several enhancements that could go into a paid version.</string>
