    It must have been something
Promulgated by some well-fed face on the tube
Congenially pumping
Every hand they shake then rinse with Astro-Lube

I\'m waiting for the asteroid
To splash down and take my lovely dinosaurs
I hardly ever leave the house
Unless it\'s for a truly noble cause

Millions are watchin\'
Bracing for their hero\'s fall -- love seeing the crash
When they could be shoppin\'
For the new distraction -- baby, better cough up the cash

While I stand midst the ruins
Count the years we spent so carefully stacking the cards
And the slightest of movements
Brought them down -- now even Jesus gotta rake his own yard

[refrain]

And it musta meant something
Through my generosity -- the mortal coil of Man
Now the dog barks at something
I chain him up and practice \'til it\'s time to strike up the band

Now, once in a blue moon
I escape the gravity that keeps me in bed
And crawl toward the bathroom
Fill the tub and shit and thoroughly soak my head

[refrain]
