It must have been something
Promulgated by some well-fed face on the tube
Congenially pumping
Every hand they shake then rinse with Astro-Lube

I'm waiting for the asteroid
To splash down and take my lovely dinosaurs
I hardly ever leave the house
Unless it's for a truly noble cause

Millions are watchin'
Bracing for their hero's fall &#8212; love seeing the crash
When they could be shoppin'
For the new distraction &#8212; baby, better cough up the cash
\n
While I stand midst the ruins
Count the years we spent so carefully stacking the cards\n
And the slightest of movements
Brought them down &#8212; now even Jesus gotta rake his own yard\n

[refrain]

And it musta meant something
Through my generosity &#8212; the mortal coil of Man\n
Now the dog barks at something
I chain him up and practice 'til it's time to strike up the band\n

Now, once in a blue moon
I escape the gravity that keeps me in bed
And crawl toward the bathroom
Fill the tub and shit and thoroughly soak my head

[refrain]
