It must have been something\n
Promulgated by some well-fed face on the tube\n
Congenially pumping\n
Every hand they shake then rinse with Astro-Lube\n
\n
I'm waiting for the asteroid\n
To splash down and take my lovely dinosaurs\n
I hardly ever leave the house\n
Unless it's for a truly noble cause\n
\n
Millions are watchin'\n
Bracing for their hero's fall -- love seeing the crash\n
When they could be shoppin'\n
For the new distraction -- baby, better cough up the cash\n
\n
While I stand midst the ruins\n
Count the years we spent so carefully stacking the cards\n
And the slightest of movements\n
Brought them down -- now even Jesus gotta rake his own yard\n
\n
[refrain]\n
\n
And it musta meant something\n
Through my generosity -- the mortal coil of Man\n
Now the dog barks at something\n
I chain him up and practice 'til it's time to strike up the band\n
\n
Now, once in a blue moon\n
I escape the gravity that keeps me in bed\n
And crawl toward the bathroom\n
Fill the tub and shit and thoroughly soak my head\n
\n
[refrain]\n
\n
